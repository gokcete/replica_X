# My Project

A recreation of X main page, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.



### Things I struggled 

- Creating the main layout structure of the page. There are 3 columns: First one is navigation sidebar, it is fixed and covers the whole height. Second one is main feed, needs to scroll normally. Third one is aside section. It scrolls until the end of its own content and remains fixed after that.

- Message-box at the bottom-right corner of the page. I didn't use any JavaScript in this project, so I added the box only as an alert box.

- Using grid property of Bootstrap. I struggled to create the desired layouts using rows and columns, but managed to achieve more or less the result I wanted.


### Things that didn't work as I intended

- Scroll of the third column. It scrolls separate from the main feed. Probably JavaScript is needed.
- Background-color change on hover on main feed posts. There should be no margin/padding.



### Things left to do

- On mobile view, backgrounds of sidebar nav icons on hover are not in place.
- Adding tooltips to post infos on hover
